# Description

## Removes smoke, dust, camera effects (heat wave in ashlands), and keeps things lit so you can breathe easy. Azumatt's NoDust series is included in this mod.
#### Azumatt's NoDust series override's this mod. The patches that handle that will not run if Azumatt's NoDust series (or singular mods) is/are installed.

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed. This is mostly for the Stay Lit option, since that's the only one synced with the server. Keep it client side only if you simply want to use the other options.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync configs that have the [Synced with Server] tag to the client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

Overly simple for now.
